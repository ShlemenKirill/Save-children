Yes, after an abortion, of course, she will not be put in prison. But from a moral point of view, how will her act look to herself?

Then it seemed to me that he was so mature, authoritative and, of course, I fell in love. Unfortunately, he did not come from a prosperous family, but it did not scare me at the time. I loved and was loved.",

Instead of greetings and happiness, she heard a cold: \"Abortion! Or you are not my daughter!\". I admit, I wanted to have an abortion until the last moment, but I couldn't. How many different thoughts then ate away at my heart, and sometimes regret about the lost own life tormented me mercilessly.",

Negative thoughts destroyed even more from the inside. And then... Then there was a divorce, and after the shocks I experienced - an illness... It was at that time that I reevaluated my own life and realized that my daughter is the most valuable gift given to me by God... The time even came when my child saved me from suicide. It was then that I thought: \"Eight years ago I saved a little life, and now my angel is saving me!\"",
        "p16": "My daughter gives me faith and an incentive to fight for life. I love her more than life! And all the time I remind her about my feelings. Remind children of your love as often as possible... Love is the greatest power that saves."
