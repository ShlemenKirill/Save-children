She will think about herself as a person and a woman. Does she even want to have children? What will her life be filled with?

Yes, after an abortion, of course, she will not be put in prison. But from a moral point of view, how will her act look to herself? A pregnant woman can answer : \"But I can manage my body!\" Then you can ask: \"Why are you sure that this is completely your body?

Not having received love and warmth from my relatives, I received it from my future husband. My future husband was six years older than me. Then it seemed to me that he was so mature, authoritative and, of course, I fell in love. Unfortunately, he did not come from a prosperous family, but it did not scare me at the time. I loved and was loved.",
        "p13": "Our relationship developed rapidly, soon we started living together and I became pregnant. After learning about the pregnancy, I was filled with fear. I confess that I was not able to share the news with my mother then, I was too afraid of her. We never had such conversations and my mother painted my future in a completely different way.",
        "p14": "And later it turned out that the husband was not ready for family life either. I told my mother about my pregnancy in the 8th week of pregnancy. Instead of greetings and happiness, she heard a cold: \"Abortion! Or you are not my daughter!\". I admit, I wanted to have an abortion until the last moment, but I couldn't. How many different thoughts then ate away at my heart, and sometimes regret about the lost own life tormented me mercilessly.",
        "p15": "After childbirth and the birth of my daughter, everything got worse. My mother hated me, and her newborn daughter and her husband even more. Negative thoughts destroyed even more from the inside. And then... Then there was a divorce, and after the shocks I experienced - an illness... It was at that time that I reevaluated my own life and realized that my daughter is the most valuable gift given to me by God... The time even came when my child saved me from suicide. It was then that I thought: \"Eight years ago I saved a little life, and now my angel is saving me!\"",
        "p16": "My daughter gives me faith and an incentive to fight for life. I love her more than life! And all the time I remind her about my feelings. Remind children of your love as often as possible... Love is the greatest power that saves."
